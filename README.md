# Introduction
The seed for Banana Run was sown in the heart of New York during NFT NYC Week 2023. It was a simple concept: create an engaging endless runner game where players could earn digital currency, threading in the whimsy and playful essence of my personal brand and artwork that often features bananas.

# Transition to Farcaster Frames
While the mobile endless runner remains in development, a pivot towards Farcaster frames offers an immediate avenue for community engagement. Banana Run within Farcaster frames is a gateway, an interactive 'Choose Your Own Adventure' narrative that galvanizes player interaction and serves as a proof of concept for the overarching vision.

# Mechanics and Community Interaction
The game operates on a simple mechanic: players navigate through a castle, confronting various scenarios presented in retro 8-bit style frames. Their choices can lead to treasure, traps, or confrontations with a formidable ape boss. The community's collective experience and feedback during these sessions are instrumental in refining game elements for the mobile version.

# Funding and Development
Rather than prioritizing direct fundraising, the focus is on cultivating an active gaming community. Contributions are funneled into a communal treasury, fueling both the reward pool and the ongoing development of Banana Run. There is also active grant submissions being made to various superchain funding programs.

# Future Direction
The future for Banana Run includes the creation of a mobile endless runner game. The core design integrates direct gameplay rewards, marrying the fun of an engaging runner with the tangible benefits of cryptocurrency incentives. This standalone game will expand upon the "Banana Run" universe, allowing players to navigate through a series of challenges and environments that reflect the original art and humor. Development prioritizes user experience, with smooth mechanics and a clear rewards system. Our objective is to deliver a game that not only entertains but also offers value to our community. Further details will be released as development progresses. It's a project birthed from community support, with aspirations to reward that same community through gameplay.
