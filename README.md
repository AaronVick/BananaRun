# BananaRun
# Introduction
The seed for Banana Run was sown in the heart of New York during NFT NYC Week 2023. It was a simple concept: create an engaging endless runner game where players could earn digital currency, threading in the whimsy and playful essence of my personal brand and artwork that often features bananas.

# Transition to Farcaster Frames
While the mobile endless runner remains in development, a pivot towards Farcaster frames offers an immediate avenue for community engagement. Banana Run within Farcaster frames is a gateway, an interactive 'Choose Your Own Adventure' narrative that galvanizes player interaction and serves as a proof of concept for the overarching vision.

# Mechanics and Community Interaction
The game operates on a simple mechanic: players navigate through a castle, confronting various scenarios presented in retro 8-bit style frames. Their choices can lead to treasure, traps, or confrontations with a formidable ape boss. The community's collective experience and feedback during these sessions are instrumental in refining game elements for the mobile version.

# Funding and Development
Rather than prioritizing direct fundraising, the focus is on cultivating an active gaming community. Contributions are funneled into a communal treasury, fueling both the reward pool and the ongoing development of Banana Run. There is also active grant submissions being made to various superchain funding programs.

# Future Direction
Banana Run is envisioned to evolve into a mobile endless runner with integrated rewards, all the while maintaining the game's intrinsic fun and engaging character. It's a project birthed from community support, with aspirations to reward that same community through gameplay.

# Conclusion
This project is not just about launching a game; it's about leveraging the collective creativity and support of the community to realize a shared vision. Banana Run is an evolving story, with the Farcaster frames representing the current chapter and the endless runner the next. Through your support and active engagement, we're crafting an experience that's as rewarding to play as it is to build. Join us in this journey, contribute your insights, and be part of the 'Banana Run' story.
